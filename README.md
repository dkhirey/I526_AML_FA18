# I526 Applied Machine Learning (Fall 2018)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for I526 AML. Here you will find many of the notebooks and datasets we will be using this semester. 
Content has been structured as follows:

* __Assignments:__ Notebooks and data for each graded homework assignment. 
* __Labs:__ Notebooks and data for each weekly lab.  These are ungraded, but important practice resources.
* __Project:__ Model notebook and additional resources for the final class project.
* __Slides:__ Slides used for the module videos and more.
* __Solutions:__ Solutions to the class assignments. These will be posted after each assignment is graded, so you can compare your work to a model solution.
* __Supplements:__ Additional resources (that don't fit into one of the other areas).

## Class Primer ##
The [class primer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F0o5rO9B1rKvhfM-60JV27Cfw83B21TkExjgBYLCDE0/edit?usp=sharing) contains all of the information you need to set up and test your environment (python/jupyter) for this class.  This document also contains background material to help you brush up on python, linear algebra, calculus and machine learning concepts required for this class.
